# dusk2dawn
Dusk2Dawn plugin for the EEGLAB toolbox in MATLAB.

- Dusk2Dawn allows users to easily clean whole-night sleep EEG data using sleep-specific implementations of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR). 
- The accessible GUI interface also allows users to easily test a range of ASR parameters and visualise the effects on their data (e.g. the effects on Slow-Wave amplitude), before deciding which set of parameters to use. 
- The plugin uses functions from the official 'clean_rawdata' ASR plugin included in recent versions of EEGLAB.
